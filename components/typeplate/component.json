Pattern libraries don&rsquo;t separate styling and markup, making them tough to use in a truly modular fashion. We weren&rsquo;t satisfied, so we made a thing that doesn&rsquo;t do that.\n\nTypeplate is a \"typographic starter kit\". We don&rsquo;t make aesthetic design choices, but define proper markup with extensible styling for common typographic patterns. A stripped&ndash;down Sass library concerned with the appropriate technical implementation of design patterns&ndash;not how they look.\n\n## Broweser Tested, Developer Approved\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/paulirish/browser-logos/master/all-desktop.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"375\">\n\n## File Size\nNot much goin&rsquo; on here in terms of bulk. As you can see, Typeplate is just a measely 3kb when compressed. That's really, really small.\n\n**Sass, LESS & Stylus**\n\n- Raw = **17kb**\n- Compressed = **3kb**\n\n**CSS**\n\n- Raw = **6kb**\n\n## Installation\nBased on use cases, we recommend using typeplate just after your reset stylesheet (i.e. [normalize](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css)) and your compass ``@import`` in order to operate as we've intended, but as you'll see from our <a href=\"//typeplate.com/demo\">demo</a> it isn't necessary.\n\n###&sect; Installation via Bower\n\nYup that&rsquo;s right! We&rsquo;re in the bower package registry. Simply run ``bower install typeplate`` and watch the magic happen. This is an example of how to include either version in your project. We should also mention that Compass is totally optional.\n\n**Sass**\n\n\t@import \"compass\";\n\t@import \"[your_project_path]/reset\";\n\t@import \"[root_project_path]/components/scss/typeplate\";\n\t\n**LESS**\n\n\t@import \"compass\";\n\t@import \"[your_project_path]/reset\";\n\t@import \"[root_project_path]/components/less/typeplate.less\";\n\t\n**Stylus**\n\n\t@import \"compass\";\n\t@import \"[your_project_path]/reset\";\n\t@import \"[root_project_path]/components/stylus/typeplate.styl\";\n\t\n**CSS**\n\nYou could also use the CSS version instead (btw&hellip;we don&rsquo;t condone this method depicted below. In reality you should copy the contents of the CSS file and paste the contents in the top of your projects stylesheet):\n\n\t<head>\n\t\t<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"[root_project_path]/components/normalize-css/normalize.css\">\n\t\t<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"[root_project_path]/components/css/typeplate.css\">\n\t</head>\n\n## Bower Installation\n\n&sect; **Package Management** : [Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower)\n\nIn order to install bower you must first have [Node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.org) installed on your machine. Once [Node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.org) are installed simply run the command below  (which works on both Windows/Mac and one of the reasons why we chose it).\n\n\tnpm install bower -g\n\n##What Else Is There?\n\nWith so many packages to choose from, we recommend a few libraries to use with Typeplate to compliment. Bon Appetite!\n\n1. [FitText.js](http://fittextjs.com) &ndash; A jQuery plugin for inflating web type\n2. [LETTERING.JS](http://letteringjs.com) &ndash; A jQuery plugin for radical web typography\n\n######©credits\nTypeplate &copy;2013 &bull; A [@grayghostvisuals](https://twitter.com/gryghostvisuals) and [@zakkain](https://twitter.com/zakkain) Joint™\nLogo Crafting by [@TommyCreenan](https://twitter.com/TommyCreenan).\n",
