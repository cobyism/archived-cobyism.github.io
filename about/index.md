## About

Hi there! I’m Coby Chapple. I work on product at [Intercom](https://intercom.com), a company that’s on a mission to make business much more personal and human. I [write]({{ site.baseurl }}blog/) and [speak]({{ site.baseurl }}speaking/) about working remotely, building products, and technology in general.

Outside of my work I enjoy [photography](https://instagram.com/cobyism), mountain biking, and generally being active. In various past lives I’ve been a hip-hop teacher, competitive breakdancer, gold-medal barbershop singer, and 11 time national modern jive champion. I have a fairly fierce competitive streak.

I’m originally from [New Zealand](http://cl.ly/ac0r), and also lived in [Australia](http://cl.ly/abvL) for over a decade too, before moving to the UK in 2012. I mostly work from my home Perthshire, Scotland. It's beautiful here. You should visit.
